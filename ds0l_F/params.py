# the speed limit within parking area is 15 miles per hour i.e. 22 ft/sec
# we assume an approximate value of 23 ft/sec 
# so that for 0-degree (short/normal) configurations it takes 1 sec to drive through the length of one boarding spot

# the data source is the handbook unless noted otherwise
# in general it assumes the design vehicle has a width of 6'7'' and a length of 17'1''

# the data for 0-degree configurations is obtained from the parallel parking stall design
# the parallel stall length is 23'0'' 
# the width projection with minimum level of comfort is 8'3'' 
# with an aisle width of 12' for one-way traffic; or with an aisle width of 22'4'' for two-way traffic
# the width projection with generous level of comfort is 9'0'' 
# with an aisle width of 15'0'' for one-way traffic and 25'4'' for two-way traffic
# our model does not model two-way traffic within the pickup and dropoff facility

# now if we increase the length of each boarding spot,
# it is likely that time for enter and exit maneuvers are likely to decrease 
# thus we also define the parameters for 0-degree (long) configurations
# the data source is from Peter's writeup
# the long parallel stall length is 32'6''

# the data for 90-degree configurations is obtained from the 90-degree parking stall design
# the 90-degree vehicle projection is 17'9''
# and the width projection with minimum level of comfort is 8'3'' with an aisle width of 23' for one-way and two-way traffic
# and the width projection with generous level of comfort is 9'0'' with an aisle width of 26'0'' for one-way and two-way traffic
